Some entities in the industry also provide consumer-to-consumer money transfers, money orders, prepaid debit cards, and bill payment services.

BRK/A,US0846701086,Berkshire Hathaway Inc,Financials,Insurance,FN-IN,"The Insurance industry provides both traditional and non-traditional insurance-related products. Traditional policy lines include property, life, casualty and reinsurance. Non-traditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers and financial guarantees. Entities in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance entities generally operate within a single segment in the industry, for example, property and casualty, although some large insurance entities have diversified operations. Similarly, entities may vary based on the level of their geographical segmentation. Whereas large entities may underwrite insurance premiums in many countries, smaller entities generally operate in a single country or jurisdiction. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance entities provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance entities, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, reducing incentives to improve underlying behaviour and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability-related impacts. Like other financial institutions, insurance entities face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, regulators have identified entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and therefore more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, some insurance entities may be designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to increased regulation and oversight."

NTGAZ,TRENTGZ00014,Naturelgaz Sanayi ve Ticaret AS,Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,IF-GU,"The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry consists of gas distribution and marketing entities. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities’ transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."

Entities in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance entities generally operate within a single segment in the industry, for example, property and casualty, although some large insurance entities have diversified operations. Similarly, entities may vary based on the level of their geographical segmentation.

Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance entities provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance entities, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, reducing incentives to improve underlying behaviour and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability-related impacts. Like other financial institutions, insurance entities face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, regulators have identified entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and therefore more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, some insurance entities may be designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to increased regulation and oversight."

Entities in the industry range from large multi-jurisdictional asset managers with a wide range of investable products, strategies and asset classes to small boutique entities providing services to specific market niches. While large entities generally compete based on management fees charged for their services as well as their potential to generate superior investment performance, the smaller entities generally compete on their ability to provide products and services customised to satisfy the diversification needs of individual clients. The global 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulatory regime developments highlight the industry’s importance in providing fair advice to customers and managing risks at the entity, portfolio and macroeconomic levels."

AYES,TREAYES00011,Ayes Celik Hasir ve Cit Sanayi AS,Extractives & Minerals Processing,Iron & Steel Producers,EM-IS,"The Iron & Steel Producers industry primarily consists of entities producing iron and steel in mills and foundries. The steel producers segment produces iron and steel products from its own mills. These products include flat-rolled sheets, tin plates, pipes, tubes, and products made of stainless steel, titanium and high alloy steels. Iron and steel foundries, which cast various products, typically purchase iron and steel from other entities. The industry also includes metal service centres and other metal merchant wholesalers, which distribute, import or export ferrous products. Though entities are developing alternative processes, steel production primarily relies on two primary methods: the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which uses iron ore as an input, and the electric arc furnace (EAF), which uses scrap steel. Many entities in the industry operate on an international scale. Note: With a few exceptions, most entities do not mine their own ore to manufacture steel and iron products. There exists a separate standard for the Metals & Mining (EM-MM) industry."

ABTZY,US0037253061,Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc,Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,IF-EU,"Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry entities generate electricity; build, own and operate transmission and distribution (T&D) lines; and sell electricity. Utilities generate electricity from many different sources, commonly including coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, solar, wind and other renewable and fossil fuel energy sources. The industry comprises entities operating in both regulated and unregulated business structures. Regulated utilities face comprehensive regulatory oversight of their pricing mechanisms and their allowed return on equity, among other types of regulation, to maintain their licence to operate as a monopoly. Unregulated entities or merchant power entities are often independent power producers (IPPs) that generate electricity to sell to the wholesale market, which includes regulated utility buyers and other end users. Furthermore, entities in the industry may operate across both regulated and deregulated power markets depending on their operational span. Regulated markets typically contain vertically integrated utilities that own and operate everything from the generation of power to its retail distribution. Deregulated markets commonly split generation from distribution to encourage wholesale power generation competition. Overall, the complex task of providing reliable, accessible, low-cost power while balancing the protection of human life and the environment remains a challenge."

Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities’ transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."

SANDHA,BD0718SALI06,Sandhani Life Insurance Co Ltd,Financials,Insurance,FN-IN,"The Insurance industry provides both traditional and non-traditional insurance-related products. Traditional policy lines include property, life, casualty and reinsurance. Non-traditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers and financial guarantees. Entities in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance entities generally operate within a single segment in the industry, for example, property and casualty, although some large insurance entities have diversified operations. Similarly, entities may vary based on the level of their geographical segmentation. Whereas large entities may underwrite insurance premiums in many countries, smaller entities generally operate in a single country or jurisdiction. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance entities provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance entities, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, reducing incentives to improve underlying behaviour and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability-related impacts. Like other financial institutions, insurance entities face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, regulators have identified entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and therefore more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, some insurance entities may be designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to increased regulation and oversight."

AMG1L,LT0000128696,AB Amber Grid,Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,IF-GU,"The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry consists of gas distribution and marketing entities. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities’ transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."

The global 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulatory regime developments highlight the industry’s importance in providing fair advice to customers and managing risks at the entity, portfolio and macroeconomic levels."
IRMENERG,INE07U701015,IRM Energy Ltd,Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,IF-GU,"The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry consists of gas distribution and marketing entities. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities’ transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."

Regulated utilities face comprehensive regulatory oversight of their pricing mechanisms and their allowed return on equity, among other types of regulation, to maintain their licence to operate as a monopoly. Unregulated entities or merchant power entities are often independent power producers (IPPs) that generate electricity to sell to the wholesale market, which includes regulated utility buyers and other end users. Furthermore, entities in the industry may operate across both regulated and deregulated power markets depending on their operational span. Regulated markets typically contain vertically integrated utilities that own and operate everything from the generation of power to its retail distribution.

AKGRT,TRAAKGRT91O5,Aksigorta AS,Financials,Insurance,FN-IN,"The Insurance industry provides both traditional and non-traditional insurance-related products. Traditional policy lines include property, life, casualty and reinsurance. Non-traditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers and financial guarantees. Entities in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance entities generally operate within a single segment in the industry, for example, property and casualty, although some large insurance entities have diversified operations. Similarly, entities may vary based on the level of their geographical segmentation. Whereas large entities may underwrite insurance premiums in many countries, smaller entities generally operate in a single country or jurisdiction. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance entities provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance entities, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, reducing incentives to improve underlying behaviour and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability-related impacts. Like other financial institutions, insurance entities face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, regulators have identified entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and therefore more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, some insurance entities may be designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to increased regulation and oversight."

While large entities generally compete based on management fees charged for their services as well as their potential to generate superior investment performance, the smaller entities generally compete on their ability to provide products and services customised to satisfy the diversification needs of individual clients. The global 2008 financial crisis and subsequent regulatory regime developments highlight the industry’s importance in providing fair advice to customers and managing risks at the entity, portfolio and macroeconomic levels."

Although relatively immature, the industry is characterised by high-growth entities that place a heavy emphasis on innovation and depend on human and intellectual capital. The industry also includes IT services entities delivering specialised IT functions, such as consulting and outsourced services. New industry business models include cloud computing, software as a service, virtualisation, machine-to-machine communication, big data analysis and machine learning. Additionally, brand value is important for entities in the industry to scale and achieve network effects, whereby wide adoption of a particular software product may result in self-perpetuating growth in sales."
NHPC,INE848E01016,NHPC Ltd,Infrastructure,Electric Utilities & Power Generators,IF-EU,"Electric Utilities & Power Generators industry entities generate electricity; build, own and operate transmission and distribution (T&D) lines; and sell electricity. Utilities generate electricity from many different sources, commonly including coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, solar, wind and other renewable and fossil fuel energy sources. The industry comprises entities operating in both regulated and unregulated business structures. Regulated utilities face comprehensive regulatory oversight of their pricing mechanisms and their allowed return on equity, among other types of regulation, to maintain their licence to operate as a monopoly. Unregulated entities or merchant power entities are often independent power producers (IPPs) that generate electricity to sell to the wholesale market, which includes regulated utility buyers and other end users. Furthermore, entities in the industry may operate across both regulated and deregulated power markets depending on their operational span. Regulated markets typically contain vertically integrated utilities that own and operate everything from the generation of power to its retail distribution. Deregulated markets commonly split generation from distribution to encourage wholesale power generation competition. Overall, the complex task of providing reliable, accessible, low-cost power while balancing the protection of human life and the environment remains a challenge."

GUJGA,INE844O01030,Gujarat Gas Ltd,Infrastructure,Gas Utilities & Distributors,IF-GU,"The Gas Utilities & Distributors industry consists of gas distribution and marketing entities. Gas distribution involves operating local, low-pressure pipes to transfer natural gas from larger transmission pipes to end users. Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities’ transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."
